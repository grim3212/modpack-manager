## Modpack Manager for Minecraft

#### Very basic at the moment

This can handle the download and updating of modpacks and mods from curseforge.

## Suggestions

I am open to suggestions on how to make this more user friendly or just general enchancements you think would make it better.
If you have any please open a issue with [Suggestion] in the title

## How to use

Just double click the jar to begin. 

The first thing you would want to do is make sure the instance folder is set properly.

This is where you want the manager to create and download your modpacks.
If you ware using [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) this should be your instance folder.

After you have set the instance folder you can add an instance. Click the Add Instance button at the top.

Supply it with a name and the url can be one of the following

- CurseForge link to a modpack file
- FeedtheBeast link to a modpack file
- A local zip file (use the '...' button to the right)
- A link to a zip (untested)

Then click confirm and it will start downloading!
While downloading it will display a console so you can get an idea of whats going on.

If using MultiMC you should now be able to start it and the new modpack will be listed!
It should already the packs Minecraft and Forge versions set.

If a new version is released you can update it simply by clicking the update button below the modpack
This url can be one of the following listed previously.

While updating it will not redownload already download mods for that pack and will remove overrides/mods that are no longer used.
